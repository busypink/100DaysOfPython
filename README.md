# 100 Days of Python

`100 days of Python` is a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu, inspired by the `100 days of Code` challenge. 

I've been uploading my progress with the daily exercises and projects to this repository in order to remind myself of how much I can accomplish with dedication and hard work.
